# TLC303 - Usecase 2 - Throughput Forecasting

The 5G N3 interface performs the role of conveying user data from the RAN to the User Plane Function, making it possible to create both low- and high-latency services. The throughput of the N3 interface is a key measure when it comes to a 5G network and it is important to forecast any bottlenecks on this interface.

This use case shows how we can use the n3_thorughput data published by a producer on a consumer account that requires to forecast and take actions based on the outcome of the forecast.

By using QuickSight ML powered insights, we demonstrate how this functionality can be achieved with minimal machine learning knowledge.

The steps involved in this use case are as follows:

**1. Launch a Quicksight account**

**2. Provide permissions to the Quicksight user to access the catalog and database**

**3. Configure the dataset**

**4. Configure a line graph visual analysis of the throughput against time.**

**5. Configure the ML driven forecast**
  **a. Graph**
  **b. Narrative insight**
