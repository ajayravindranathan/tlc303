# TLC303 - Use case 3 - Customer churn prediction using XGBOOST supervised binary classification

Customer churn is a business challenge that all Communication Service Providers encounter on a daily basis. The goal of this use case is to look at historical data from the network, subscribed products, usage, and pricing that has been shared from a consumer account in order to predict the conditions under which a particular customer is likely to churn.

This use case involves the following steps as listed below. Please browse to the respective readme files for each step and execute the steps in the specfied order below.

**1. Launch Amazon Sagemaker Studio**
